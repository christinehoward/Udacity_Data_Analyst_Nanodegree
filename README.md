Completed the entire data analysis process with Python using a dataset on no-show appointments: wrangled data, completed an exploratory data analysis, created visualizations, and made conclusions.

### Project 2: Analyze A/B Test Results
Analyzed A/B Test results using Python and practical statistics to help an e-commerce website understand if they should implement a new webpage design.

### Project 3: Wrangle and Analyze Data
Used Python to gather data from a variety of sources, assess its quality and tidiness, clean it, and then showcase wrangling efforts through analyses and visualizations.

### Project 4: Communicate Data Findings
